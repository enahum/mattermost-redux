# Mattermost Redux (unreleased)  

**Supported Server Versions:** Master (no released versions are currently supported) 

This is an unreleased project for replacing the current implementation of the store with Redux. The project is not yet stable, and the instructions are for internal use currently (i.e. probably out-of-date until we stablize). 

We'll post updates to our [Forums](http://forum.mattermost.org/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattermosthq) when we're ready to bring in more community contributors. 

Mattermost is an open source Slack-alternative used by thousands of companies around the world in 11 languages. Learn more at https://mattermost.com.
